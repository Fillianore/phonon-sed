Python code to calculate SED for an FCC-diamond solid - python2.7

# Calc
This directory contains the SED code and required module.

# Relax
LAMMPS input script and input data file to relax a 30x30x30 Si structure using a tricilinic simulation box. NOTE: this has already been done and is only included as an example code: data.vels is the output.

# Vels
LAMMPS input script to collect velocity data. data.vels is the input data (output from relaxation). 

# Deprecated
Old version of the SED code.
