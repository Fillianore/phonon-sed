# pSED
Python code to calculate the phonon spectral energy density (psed) from molecular dynamics simulations. The executable is pSED and can ran from the command line as ./pSED. For more info, read the included 'manual.pdf' file. 

# modules
The files containing all the subroutines and classes used by pSED.

# lammps
Some sample LAMMPS input files

# structure_maker_API
This directory contains a file that can use subroutines in Lattice.py to generate crystal structures for simulations. It also creates the file 'lattice.dat' needed by pSED
